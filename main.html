    <p><b>Main articles:</b> History of blogging and online diary</p>
    
    <p>
        A "diary" style blog with text and images was sent wirelessly from a wearable computer on February 22, 1995. Jorn Barger coined "weblog" on December 17, 1997. In April or May 1999, Peter Merholz shortened it to "blog" by breaking "weblog" into "we blog." Evan Williams at Pyra Labs later used "blog" as a noun and verb, coining "blogger" in connection with the Blogger platform. This helped popularize the terms.[17]

    <h2>Origins</h2>

    <p>
        Before blogging, digital communities existed in many forms. These included Usenet, GEnie, Byte Information Exchange (BIX), early CompuServe, e-mail lists,[18] and Bulletin Board Systems (BBS).
