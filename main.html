    <h1>History of Blogging</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Main articles:</strong> <a href="#">History of blogging</a> and <a href="#">online diary</a></p>
    
    <p>
       An early example of a <strong>"diary" style blog</strong> consisted of text and images transmitted wirelessly in real-time from a wearable computer with a head-up display on <strong>February 22, 1995</strong>.  
       The term <strong>"weblog"</strong> was coined by <strong>Jorn Barger</strong> on <strong>December 17, 1997</strong>.  
       The short form, <strong>"blog"</strong>, was coined by <strong>Peter Merholz</strong>, who jokingly broke the word "weblog" into the phrase **"we blog"** in the sidebar of his blog <strong>Peterme.com</strong> in <strong>April or May 1999</strong>.  
       Shortly thereafter, <strong>Evan Williams</strong> at <strong>Pyra Labs</strong> used "blog" as both a noun and verb ("to blog", meaning "to edit one's weblog or to post to one's weblog") and devised the term <strong>"blogger"</strong> in connection with Pyra Labs' Blogger product, leading to the popularization of these terms.

    <h2>Origins</h2>

    <p>
        Before blogging became popular, digital communities took many forms, including <strong>Usenet, GEnie, Byte Information Exchange (BIX), early CompuServe, email lists</strong>, and <strong>Bulletin Board Systems (BBS)</strong>.
