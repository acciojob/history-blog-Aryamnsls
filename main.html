    <h1>History</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Main articles:</strong> History of blogging and online diary</p>
    
    <p>
        A diary-style blog with text and images was sent wirelessly from a wearable computer on February 22, 1995. Jorn Barger coined "weblog" on December 17, 1997. In 1999, Peter Merholz shortened it to "blog" by splitting "weblog" into "we blog." Evan Williams at Pyra Labs later popularized "blog" as a noun and verb. He also coined "blogger" for the Blogger platform.[17]
